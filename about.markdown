Zarr is a community project to develop specifications and software for storage of large N-dimensional typed arrays, also commonly known as
tensors. A particular focus of Zarr is to provide support for storage using distributed systems like cloud object stores, and to enable efficient I/O for parallel computing applications.

Zarr is motivated by the need for a simple, transparent, open, and community-driven format that supports high-throughput distributed I/O on different storage systems. Zarr data can be stored in any storage system that can be represented as a key-value store, including most commonly POSIX file systems and cloud object storage but also zip files as well as relational and document databases.
